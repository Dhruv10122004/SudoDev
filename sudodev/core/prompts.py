6. **CRITICAL DJANGO SETUP - FOLLOW THIS EXACT ORDER:**

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE EXACTLY:**
```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings

# STEP 1: Configure Django FIRST (before ANY other Django imports)
if not settings.configured:
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.auth',
        ],
        SECRET_KEY='test-secret-key',
        USE_TZ=True,
    )

# STEP 2: Call setup() immediately after configure()
django.setup()

# STEP 3: NOW you can import Django components (ONLY AFTER setup)
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Q, Subquery, F
from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL
from django.db.models.sql.compiler import SQLCompiler

# Your test code here...
```

**MANDATORY RULES (WILL CRASH IF NOT FOLLOWED):**
- settings.configure() must be called BEFORE importing models, queries, expressions, or any Django ORM
- django.setup() must be called immediately after configure()
- Import django.db.models and related components ONLY AFTER django.setup()
- Do NOT define Model classes unless absolutely necessary
- For SQL/compiler/expression bugs, test the component directly without defining models

**Example for SQL/Compiler bugs (preferred approach):**
```python
# Do the setup first (as shown above)
django.setup()

# Then import what you need
from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL

# Test the specific bug without defining models
sql = RawSQL("SELECT * FROM table\\nORDER BY id", [])
# Test code to reproduce the bug
print("Testing multiline SQL:", repr(sql.sql))
```

**Only if you MUST define a model:**
```python
# Setup first (as shown above)
django.setup()

# Import after setup
from django.db import models

# Define model after all setup is complete
class TestModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'test_app'  # Required when not in INSTALLED_APPS
```

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['TESTING'] = True
